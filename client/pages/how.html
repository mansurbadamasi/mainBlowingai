            mainBlowingAI is a natural language processing (NLP) system that uses a deep learning model to generate responses to user input. 
            It is based on the OpenAI GPT-2 model, which was trained on a large corpus of text from the internet.
             The system takes in user input and generates a response based on the context of the conversation. 
             The response is generated using a combination of natural language processing techniques such as word embeddings, recurrent neural networks, 
             and transformers. mainB lowingAI can be used for various applications such as customer service chatbots, virtual assistants, and more.
